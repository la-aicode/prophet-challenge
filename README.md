# Forecasting Net Prophet

This project analyzes and forecasts the search traffic and stock price patterns of MercadoLibre, a popular e-commerce site in Latin America. The goal is to identify unusual patterns in search traffic, mine the data for seasonality, relate search traffic to stock price patterns, and create a time series model with Prophet.

## Project Steps

The project is divided into four main steps:

1. **Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic**: This step involves analyzing hourly Google search traffic data for MercadoLibre to identify any unusual patterns or connections to financial events.
2. **Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality**: This step focuses on identifying predictable seasonal patterns in the search traffic data, including daily, weekly, and yearly trends.
3. **Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns**: This step explores the relationship between search traffic and stock price patterns by concatenating the two datasets and analyzing their trends.
4. **Create a Time Series Model with Prophet**: This step involves using the Prophet forecasting model to analyze and forecast patterns in the hourly search data.
